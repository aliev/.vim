### Powerline for tmux

https://github.com/erikw/tmux-powerline

if you use tmux, possible for you will use the following configuration

```
# don't wait for an escape sequence after hitting
# Esc. fixes insert mode exit lag in vim
set -sg escape-time 0
set -g terminal-overrides 'xterm*:smcup@:rmcup@'
```

It seems all is well until it comes to using iTerm2 on OSX. Suddenly scrolling
back in the outer terminal shows history from prior to the start of tmux. There
are no end of suggestions about how to fix this, including "disable the status bar"
and "it should just work". Actually itâ€™s fairly simple.

Enable the option under "Preferences -> Profiles -> Terminal" called
``` Save lines to scrollback when an app status bar is present ```
